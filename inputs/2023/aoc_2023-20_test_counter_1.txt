# binary counter:
# flip-flops "ffN" are state
# wires from flip-flops to nand are terminal condition
# wires from nand to flip-flops are reseting flip-flops after condition is reached
# "out" is for negation
# fan_nand is for integrating many counters to output to "rx" only when every counter hits the condition

# this particular counter has 6 bits, and terminates when 0,3,4,6 bits is high (which gives a value of 89)
